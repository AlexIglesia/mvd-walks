The website is created mainly for tourists but also for any person interested in participating in a free walking tour in the city of Montevideo, Uruguay.

Mvd Walks offers basic information related to the main locations to visit, meeting times and details to contact with the tour guide.

# Features

- The navigation clearly tells the user the name of the touristic company ans makes the different sections of information easy to find. 
- The color selection is beige for background. Blue is commonly asocaited as one of the colors that symbolise Uruguay, so it is implemented for text to create a contrast. Coral is used in details as a accent color.

- The form does not collect data, it provides a thank you message as feedback to simulate a real form. The method is not “post” for this reason.

## Bugs

- When I deployed my project to GitHub Pages and used the "Am I responsive?" website I discoverd the "cover-text" orange box in the home page missed a margin-button to be in the correct position.

**Unfixed Bugs**
- When I deployed my project and tried to view it on my phone the text inside the orange was overflowed and the undeline decoration text was missing.

## Validator Testing

When I validate my project to validator W3C I discovered my iframe had an error because of the % symbole being used. 

- I fixed this error removing the % symbole in the HTML and changing the height to px and the width remain in % but was stated in the css.
- Another error was created for using an H1. I change the H1 from the nav and added an H2.

**HTML**

After fixing this, no errors were returned when useing the W3C validator.

**CSS**

No errors were found when passing through the official Jigsaw validator.

**Accessibility**

I confirm that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accesible by running it through lighthouse in devtools.
